# Appointmeow
 Make appointments easier~

# How to setup:
Appointmeow is a webapp based on python Flask and Javascript React

## Basic requirement:
Python == 3.9.5

## Step 1:
Install [Node JS](https://nodejs.org)
Install [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

## Step 2:
Clone the github repository to **./Appointmeow** directory
`git clone https://github.com/Merxon22/Appointmeow.git ./Appointmeow`

Enter the following command to first create a React app. This process usually takes a few minutes.
`npx create-react-app appointmeow`
***Note that the git repository is cloned to "./Appointmeow" and the React app is created in "./appointmeow". This is because both git clone and create-react-app requires an empty directory. Therefore, we have to create them in two different directories and combine them manually later.***

Copy everything from **./Appointmeow** folder into **./appoiontmeow** folder. Overwrite every file in the **./appointmeow** folder.
Then, enter the **appointmeow** folder, install node modules:
`npm install antd`
`npm install react-router-dom`

## Step 3
Requires npm package: antd, react-router-dom
